# mars-scraping

This is a full web-scraping and data analysis project. I learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Iâ€™ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.


# What I've Created#
This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

# Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

# Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
